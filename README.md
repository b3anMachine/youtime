# youtime

YouTime is a desktop app that opens a set url in the default browser at some specified time. I wrote this application back in circa 2013 as a Java learning project and I was quite proud of it at the time. I’ve stuck this small project up in a public repo to document a few bug fixes and updates I’d like to add to it for fun.
